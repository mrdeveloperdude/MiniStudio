Basic build commands
--------------------

$ cd drumstick-x.x.x
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
    (or ccmake ..)
    (or cmake-gui ..)
    (or cmake .. -options, see below...)

For simple test/development scenarios you can also use Qmake, but the Qmake-  
based build system provides only minimal functionality.

$ make
    (or make VERBOSE=1)

$ sudo make install

$ sudo ldconfig
    (not needed if you only want STATIC_DRUMSTICK)

Requirements
------------

Minimum supported versions:

* CMake 2.8.11
* Qt5
* For Linux: ALSA 1.0

* shared-mime-info 0.30
See http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info
The utility "update-mime-database" must be executed after installing the library
"drumstick-file" and the "drumstick.xml" file. This is automatically done by 
the cmake build system unless you defined DESTDIR. In this case, your package 
manager should perform it as a post-install step. 

* Doxygen 1.5
See http://www.doxygen.org
If you want to generate the documentation for the libraries  

If you want to generate and install the man pages, the build system can do it 
if you have installed in your system the following packages:
* xsltproc program.
* docbook XSLT stylesheets.

The package names depend on the Linux distribution. For Debian they are:
xsltproc, docbook-xsl and docbook-xml. For openSUSE: libxslt, docbook_4, and 
docbook-xsl-stylesheets.

RealtimeKit actions are called through DBus, so it is not a direct dependency.
